  <h1>Accurate Representation</h1>
  <p>Congratulations! You completed the game very successfully. But what exactly does that mean?</p>
  <p>We see two potential explanations. Either you saw through the game’s design and selected only those pages which you know you already “Like” on Facebook or--and more interestingly--your Facebook persona is actually a fairly solid representation of who you really are.</p>
  <p>And just what are the implications of projecting an accurate representation of yourself on Facebook? The common argument would appear to be that you are according with Facebook’s mission to provide a place where people can interact and be themselves in a virtual community. However, that’s not actually what Facebook proclaims as its mission statement. Facebook only claims, “to give people the power to share and make the world more open and more connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what’s going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them” (Facebook Mission Statement). However, you are a part of the Facebook-using population that has decided to essentially recreate their real-world personas in Facebook’s online world.</p>
  <p>There are a few possible benefits from your “Accurate Representation” classification. First, if you have nothing to hide and are proud of your real personality and actions, showcasing them online could prove useful. For example, many employers today take Facebook sharing and postings into account when making hiring decisions in order to gain a more accurate picture of their employees. If you are highlighting a hirable individual on Facebook, this could help you acquire a job. Similarly, if you’re pleased with your persona then your Facebook could potentially be brought into court to help provide a character defense, or at the very least deny disreputable character attacks. Moreover, in the incredibly unfortunate case of your untimely demise, your Facebook will prove an excellent memorial to your tremendous life and times. And, if you’re into that kind of thing, it’s likely that the ads you will see on Facebook will be well tailored to your actual interests and desires.</p>
  <p>However, there are also a multitude of potential drawbacks to your undying Facebook honesty. To fully appreciate these, just think about all of the ideal benefit scenarios being applied to someone who would rather that their actual personality--propagated on Facebook--remained private. Whether you are battling in court, trying to get a job, hoping to have some of your more unsavory tastes die along with you, or attempting to remain anonymous in this world of data aggregation and targeted advertising, projecting your actual persona onto your Facebook could have some seriously negative consequences.</p>
  <p>Overall, there is nothing normatively bad or good about your decision to elucidate your true self via Facebook. The only thing that probably isn’t smart is doing so without fully understanding the implications.</p>

  <h1>Little/No Representation</h1>
  <p>Well then! Quite the difficult read aren’t you?</p>
  <p>You fall into an intermediate category: “Little/No Representation.” This means that you’ve flummoxed our application. But have no fear! We still have quite a few things to say about your Facebook presence and how it could affect you in the future.</p>
  <p>Your answers to our quiz prove that although you aren’t projecting an accurate picture of yourself on social media, you’re not depicting a totally false image either. Instead, you’re somewhere in the middle. You genuinely do like some of the things that you “Like” on Facebook and you’re not a huge fan of many pages that you’re not connected with on social media. Still, the overwhelming sense from your data is that you just haven’t shared a great deal of your personal information with Facebook in the first place. In this day and age, that’s probably the safest route, so maybe you can sleep a little more soundly from here on out.</p>
  <p>The benefits from your position would appear to outweigh the costs from our point of view. You need not worry about litigation turning against you because of oversharing on social media (that you’ve done thus far, anyways), the likelihood of you losing a job because of your current Facebook habits is similarly diminished, and data aggregators seeking to perfectly target you with advertising are fairly down on their luck when it comes to what you want to buy (though if you really want to see ads for that loofa you’ve been coveting, by all means, share away). Still, your generally locked-down profile could have some drawbacks. If you were to pass away--laughing too hard while skydiving, maybe?--your friends would likely not have your Facebook profile as an outlet for their grief. This may be exactly what you want, but it should be a consideration nonetheless. Moreover, if you are trying to genuinely connect with people on social media, withholding the vast majority of your personal information and interests could make forming a deep connection more difficult. Indeed, your profile in its current state likely bears more resemblance to a Tinder page than a page intended to connect you with your peers. Still, all things considered, if anonymity is what you desire, you’re doing pretty well thus far.</p>

<div ng-if="personality == 'inaccurate'">
  <h1>Inaccurate Representation</h1>
  <p>Wow! The manner in which you’ve completed the game suggests that your Facebook profile is extremely distinct from your true personality. Either that, or you’re really good at messing with us.</p>

  <p>Your answers have placed you under the “Inaccurate Representation” heading. This means that you checked off a number of pages that you don’t actually “Like” on Facebook and that you did not mark a multitude of the pages that you’ve told your Facebook friends that you “Like.” We see a few potential rationales behind your selections, assuming that they were made in good faith.</p>

  <p>First, it is entirely possible that you do not intend to project a false representation of yourself. Perhaps you “Liked” a fair portion of the pages when you first got Facebook and your preferences have since changed. If you fall into this category, your online persona raises a few interesting issues surrounding people’s narratives through time on social media.</p>

  <p>Unlike in the good ole’ olden days, if you put material up on the web when you’re a youngster, much of that data can remain in the public domain indefinitely. As such, if your positions, thoughts, or interests have evolved but you have yet to actually change your online profile, you may still be linked to ideas and desires that you have since left behind. This could prove quite problematic if your past “Likes” or other information are being leveraged against you in a court of law, held as character evidence for labor force decisions, incorrectly exploited to market products to you, or even used to represent you after your passing. If these circumstances concern you, you may wish to update the image you are projecting to the Facebook community.</p>

  <p>If instead of failing to update your page your inaccurate representation on Facebook is a deliberate ploy to obscure your true interests and identity, then let us offer a hedged congratulations: at the very least, you’ve proved your success through our game. However, many of the situations mentioned above still apply to you and could prove damaging if you haven’t fully thought through your plan. Consider a potential employer going through your Facebook and discovering a person entirely different from the one they just sat down to interview, or a jury looking through your “Likes” as evidence of your true character. Imagine the ease with which you could purchase the products that you need through targeted advertising, or the warm glow that could suffuse your loved ones as they peruse your page and recall the monumental person that is you.</p>

  <p>We are not trying to suggest that you immediately change your profile--far from it. All that we hope is that you fully understand both the benefits and drawbacks to the path that you’ve chosen. Might we choose it too? Perhaps. But certainly not without some serious thought and foresight.</p>
