<h1>Inaccurate Representation</h1>
<p>Wow! The manner in which you’ve completed the game suggests that your Facebook profile is extremely distinct from your true personality. Either that, or you’re really good at messing with us.</p>

<p>Your answers have placed you under the “Inaccurate Representation” heading. This means that you checked off a number of pages that you don’t actually “Like” on Facebook and that you did not mark a multitude of the pages that you’ve told your Facebook friends that you “Like.” We see a few potential rationales behind your selections, assuming that they were made in good faith.</p>

<p>First, it is entirely possible that you do not intend to project a false representation of yourself. Perhaps you “Liked” a fair portion of the pages when you first got Facebook and your preferences have since changed. If you fall into this category, your online persona raises a few interesting issues surrounding people’s narratives through time on social media.</p>

<p>Unlike in the good ole’ olden days, if you put material up on the web when you’re a youngster, much of that data can remain in the public domain indefinitely. As such, if your positions, thoughts, or interests have evolved but you have yet to actually change your online profile, you may still be linked to ideas and desires that you have since left behind. This could prove quite problematic if your past “Likes” or other information are being leveraged against you in a court of law, held as character evidence for labor force decisions, incorrectly exploited to market products to you, or even used to represent you after your passing. If these circumstances concern you, you may wish to update the image you are projecting to the Facebook community.</p>

<p>If instead of failing to update your page your inaccurate representation on Facebook is a deliberate ploy to obscure your true interests and identity, then let us offer a hedged congratulations: at the very least, you’ve proved your success through our game. However, many of the situations mentioned above still apply to you and could prove damaging if you haven’t fully thought through your plan. Consider a potential employer going through your Facebook and discovering a person entirely different from the one they just sat down to interview, or a jury looking through your “Likes” as evidence of your true character. Imagine the ease with which you could purchase the products that you need through targeted advertising, or the warm glow that could suffuse your loved ones as they peruse your page and recall the monumental person that is you.</p>

<p>We are not trying to suggest that you immediately change your profile--far from it. All that we hope is that you fully understand both the benefits and drawbacks to the path that you’ve chosen. Might we choose it too? Perhaps. But certainly not without some serious thought and foresight.</p>
